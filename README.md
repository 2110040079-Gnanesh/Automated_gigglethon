# Automated_gigglethon
This project introduces an innovative robotic arm powered by Arduino, designed for efficiency. It incorporates a dual-functionality system where potentiometers serve as joysticks, offering intuitive control over the robotic arm's movements. retaining the capability to manipulate heavier weights than traditional robotic arms can't manage
